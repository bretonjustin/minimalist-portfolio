            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm an outdoor enthusiast with a passion for skiing, biking, and hiking. I build simple, functional tools—often powered by APIs—to make it easier for people to access the information they need for their outdoor adventures. Whether it's crafting websites or diving into electrical and software projects, I love creating solutions that help others get outside and explore.</p>
            
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and completed multiple internships during my studies, gaining hands-on experience in both hardware and software development. Since graduating, I've been working at Boreas Technologies as an Application Engineer, where I build tailored solutions using our piezoelectric haptic driver technology to support client integration. This role bridges engineering and real-world application, allowing me to stay close to both design and problem-solving.</p>
            
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I work with Python, C, and C++ to build efficient, reliable tools—from FastAPI-based web services to low-level firmware for microcontrollers. I'm comfortable developing on Ubuntu, designing PCBs, and programming embedded systems. I also enjoy managing self-hosted services, combining software and hardware to create practical, self-reliant solutions.</p>
